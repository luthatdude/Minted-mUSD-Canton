## Section Details

### Section 1 — The Problem

**Hero headline:**
> "Forget everything you know about ownership in Web3"

**Subheadline:**
> "Utility tokens lack intrinsic value because they have no equity, ownership, or fundamental link to company performance."

**For Projects:**
- Pure speculation, regulatory uncertainty, fragmented markets, and no intrinsic value
- Price can never truly reflect organizational performance

**For Investors:**
- Illiquid token speculation divorced from performance
- No compliant access to equity upside
- Nonsensical valuations for companies earning revenue, lacking revenue, or network effects

---

### Section 2 — The Answer

> "Minted bridges decentralization and material ownership through a simple, compliant infrastructure, that unifies utility speculation with legally backed issuer material events tied to real valuations."

---

### Section 3 — How It Works

**Subheadline:**
> "A Modular Staking Pool that can be implemented within any Web3 environment."

**Body:**
> When project tokens deposit into the BLE, holders are recorded via a revolving smart contract registrar. SPV held equity is calculated according to circulating supply to produce NAV. Anyone staked in the BLE has direct exposure to corporate material events, this can include: Equity Beneficiary changes, Revenue Sharing, and Acquisition tag-a-long exposure. Holders in the BLE are only exposed to these events in this environment, and these events are issued at the issuer's discretion only.
>
> Users are NOT locked, and do not need to KYC to enter/exit the BLE to freely arbitrage against the company's NAV. It's only upon issuer execution of events will BLE stakers be given the opportunity for exposure, which requires KYC. Minted does not provide any "rights," "grants," or "contracting" of such events. They are deployed at the issuer's discretion who is in full control.

### Section 4 — Ethos

> Tokens have always acted as representations of access, utility, or governance — but not as an access marker to actual equity. This has left founders and communities structurally divided: companies grow in value, but the token ecosystems surrounding them do not share in that growth.
>
> The Web3 world has lacked an infrastructure layer that can legally, programmatically, and safely distribute true ownership to the people who create the most value. Minted introduces the first solution that unifies utility speculation with real, legally backed intrinsic value.
>
> Through Minted's first mover BLE, every token holder can choose to remain in a freely tradable utility state or opt into a regulated Beneficiary State that confers full shareholder rights. This creates an entirely new model for global participation — one where communities aren't just supporters or traders, but actual owners.
>
> By merging permissionless blockchain markets with real-world equity frameworks, Minted redefines what a token can represent and unlocks a future where ownership is accessible, programmable, and borderless.

## Key Principles

1. **Content-driven** — this is an explainer page, not an app
2. **Scroll narrative** — sections flow top-to-bottom telling a story: Problem → Answer → How → Ethos
3. **Copy is verbatim** — all text above is final from the Notion spec
4. **No app functionality** — no wallet connect, no widgets, no chain toggle
5. **Link back** — navigation includes a path back to the main Minted.app landing page
