/**
 * TEST-002: Relay Service Integration Tests (MEDIUM severity audit finding)
 *
 * Integration test stubs for the relay service covering:
 *   - Relay service initialization
 *   - Message signing and verification
 *   - Canton-Ethereum bridge message handling
 *   - Error handling for malformed messages
 *
 * NOTE: Comprehensive unit tests for relay utilities (secp256k1 key validation,
 * readSecret, readAndValidatePrivateKey, DER signature parsing) already exist in:
 *   - relay/__tests__/utils.test.ts
 *   - relay/__tests__/signer.test.ts
 *   - test/RelayIntegration.test.ts (Hardhat test suite)
 *
 * These integration stubs are designed to be filled in once a Canton test ledger
 * and Ethereum test node are available in CI.
